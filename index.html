        <p>Fahmida is currently enrolled in <a href="https://www.taehs.org/">Thomas A. Edison Career and Technical High School</a> as a 12th grader, who used to be in the Key Club. In five years time, she envisions herself being done with education, and having a Computer Science or Web Development bachelor's degree. She will have built a decent portfolio that has her own personal projects, which would then help her apply for any job in that field. Will be living independently with her own kitten.</p>
